The examination of school performance by size and type reveals distinct patterns. Schools with fewer than 1,000 students, classified as small, tend to achieve higher average scores in math and reading and exhibit better passing rates compared to medium-sized and large schools. Medium-sized schools, accommodating 1,000 to 2,000 students, show marginally lower scores and passing rates than their smaller counterparts but still surpass large schools in performance. Large schools, with student populations ranging from 2,000 to 5,000, have the lowest average scores and passing rates among the three size categories.

When evaluating by school type, Charter schools consistently perform better than District schools. They achieve higher average math and reading scores and demonstrate superior passing rates in both subjects, as well as overall. Conversely, District schools tend to have lower average scores and passing rates compared to Charter schools. This analysis highlights the considerable influence of both school size and type on student academic success, with smaller and Charter schools generally showing more favorable performance outcomes.
